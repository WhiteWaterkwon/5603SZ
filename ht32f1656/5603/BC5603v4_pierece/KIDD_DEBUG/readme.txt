@par Example Description:

This example describes how to configure USART & UART simultaneously transmit by interrupt.

The USART_CLK frequency is set to 72 MHz.

Both USARTs are configured with 8bits Word length, one stop bit, no parity and baud rate is set to 115200 bps,
remember to enable THREIE & RLSIE interrupt for both USARTs.

The USARTx_IRQHandler will make sure that URxTxReadIndex and URxTxWriteIndex value.If they are equal,
USARTx_IRQHandler will disable TFTLIE interrupt, until the value is written to URxTxBuf[] and
generate interrupt by TFTLIE set.Otherwise if the interrupt is generated by RLSIE set, USART will receive
datum to URxRxBuf[] from another USART.

- USART/HyperTerminal_TxRx_Interrupt/main.c               Main program
- USART/HyperTerminal_TxRx_Interrupt/ht32fxxxx_it.c       Interrupt handlers

@par Hardware and Software Environment:

- Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector COM1 or COM2 and PC serial port.
- You can connect USART0(CN9) to UART0(CN7), when successfully entered USART0 RLSIE interrupt, LED1 will be
  turn on.If successfully entered UART0 RFTLI_RTOIE interrupt, LED2 will be turn on.
- This example shows the result by LED1 and LED2 or hyperterminal.
- Hyperterminal configuration:
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - flow control: None
- This example can be run on HT32 Series development board.
